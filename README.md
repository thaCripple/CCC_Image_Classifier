# CCC - Image Classifier

## At first I implemented an Image Classification Model from scratch

A self study implementation of a Pytorch DL model for classifing images into 3 categories based on a custom dataset

I explored several new concepts chief of them image augmentation

## Afterwards I used a Pre-trained model from PyTorch'es library and applied it to the same task

I explored two ways of leveraging pre-trained models: finetuning and feature extraction.

For the first time in my studies of Pytorch I made the effor to functionalize most (if not all) of the workflow

## Familiarizing myself with Pre-trained models signifies a major step in my journey; it has been a big milestone on my roadmap as it paves the way for some major and exciting projects I've had in mind for some time now :grin:
